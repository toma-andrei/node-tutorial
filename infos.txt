Version control with GIT

types of file:
    commits = staged files that were bundeled into a commit are identified by a hash ex: 1ab48
    staged changes = everything that i want to commit is moved here before commit, then bundeled up into a single commit
    unstaged changes = files commited before and tracked by git
    *tracked file = file included in a previous commit
    *untracked files = files that are not tracked by git (all new files created are untracked)
